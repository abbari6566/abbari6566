## Projects

###  [movie-booking-system-fullstack](https://github.com/jualam/Movie_Booking_System)
- Developed a scalable MERN stack application with React, Express, and MongoDB, enabling monthly users to browsemovies, purchase tickets, and view order history, while admins manage inventory and analyze sales via a secure JWT-protecteddashboard.
- End-to-End Security & Performance: Implemented JWT authentication, role-based access control (admin/user), and optimizedMongoDB queries, reducing API response times by 30% and ensuring secure transactions.

###  [concrete-strength-predictor](https://github.com/jualam/Concrete-Strength)
This project analyzes a dataset containing various features of concrete mixtures to predict their compressive strength.
- Used metrics like RMSE and R-squared to evaluate model performance. We also conducted cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.  
- Random Forest model showed the best performance, with an RMSE of approximately X and an R-squared value of Y

###  [2048-pygame](https://github.com/abrarbari/2048-pygame)
Fun project recreating the 2048 game using Python and Pygame.  
-  Great for understanding matrix movement and game logic

### [huffman-coding](https://github.com/abbari6566/Huffman-Coding)
- This project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies. The goal of this implementation is to compress a string by encoding the characters into binary codes such that the most frequent characters have the shortest codes.
- Features Frequency Calculation: The program calculates the frequency of each character in the input string. Huffman Tree Construction: A binary tree is built using the characters and their frequencies.
